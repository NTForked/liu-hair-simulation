# Strands of Hair

### Making hair is a beautiful thing
Hair is an outgrowth of protein, found only on mammals. It projects from the epidermis, though it grows from hair follicles deep in the dermis. Although many other organisms, especially insects, show filamentous outgrowths, these are not considered "hair". So-called "hairs" (trichomes) are also found on plants. The projections on arthropods, such as insects and spiders are actually insect bristles, composed of a polysaccharide called chitin. The hair of non-human mammal species is commonly referred to as fur. There are varieties of cats, dogs, and mice bred to have little or no visible fur. In some species, hair is absent at certain stages of life.

The main component of hair fiber is keratin. Keratins are proteins: long chains (polymers) of amino acids.

#### The movie, 1979


This movie, based on the cult Broadway musical of the 60s, tells a story about Claude, a young man from Oklahoma who comes to New York City. There he strikes up a friendship with a group of hippies, led by Berger, and falls in love with Sheila, a girl from a rich family. However, their happiness is short because Claude must go to the Vietnam war.

##  Physical Simulation
This codebase is the outcome of a project aimed at simulating physical entities, in this case hair, by finding a proper physical representation model - the simplest one being a mass spring system.
